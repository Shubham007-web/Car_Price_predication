# Car_Price_predication
This is machine learing model to predict the car prices on given features. The dataset named car_data has 332 traing dataset, which is queit small but for the better predictive system, I used different algorithms like LinearRegression, Lasso Regression, XGB Regressor, and Support Vector Machine Regressor.
This dataset contains information about used cars. This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning. The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

1. name
2. year
3. selling_price
4. km_driven
5. fuel
6. seller_type
7. transmission
8. Owner


- Here Column sellering_price is our target value of the dataset and remain columns are features, which are used to predict our target values.
